The solution involves adding a cleanup function to the `useEffect` hook. This cleanup function will be executed when the component unmounts and will clear any references or timers associated with the `useRef` callback. This prevents the callback from executing after the component is no longer mounted.  Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const timerRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    timerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      // This callback might be called after unmount
      console.log('Timer expired!');
    }, 3000);

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timerRef.current);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Component content */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
By adding the `clearTimeout` inside the cleanup function we ensure that the callback will not run after the component is gone.
